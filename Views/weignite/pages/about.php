                                Ignite means to set on fire. We Ignite is reinventing events, not replacing events. Think of us as an extension
                                of your marketing, events, communications, training and sales teams. WeIgnite is creating a shared, immersive,
                                enjoyable, measurable and socially savvy experience for your attendees. Imagine a world where people can
                                experience a sense of presence and connectedness anytime without the boundaries and burdens of travel, weather,
                                staffing, costs, health and safety worries and environmental impact concerns. The future is now. We can Ignite
                                YOUR world with just the touch of your fingertips and watch your attendees unite in a way they’ve never done
                                before.

                                Ignite means to excite. If We Ignite looks and sounds different, it is because it is. You don’t like cookie
                                cutter events, and neither do we. You don’t want your event to have the same features as everyone else,
                                neither do we. WeIgnite was created by two virtual reality enthusiasts with a combined 30+ years of
                                experience in the technology industry, as well as an events and marketing executive with 20+ years
                                experience producing events for clients of all sizes. You will benefit from our experience and have a
                                finished product that is unique to your brand and meets your goals.

                                 And during times when you can’t meet in person for any reason whatsoever, WeIgnite can replicate any
                                 internal or external event experience. WeIgnite will work with you to ensure your attendees aka Igniters
                                 have the incomparable ability to network, educate, sell, market and have some fun too.
